# Alarm-Clock
Personal alarm clock for exercising.
You can basically put in a target time for when the exercise ends.
After which a beep will sound for rest time(1 min later) after which 2 beeps will sound (30 secs later), this cycle will continue till target time. 

Additional changes to be added:
1. Creation of a bot to open specific exercises according to the time
2. Addition of music in background, either through bot or OS
